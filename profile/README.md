Zeppe-Lin is a lightweight source-based GNU/Linux distribution for the
x86-64 architecture designed for experienced Linux users.
Forked from [CRUX][1], it adheres to the KISS (Keep It Simple)
philosophy, offering a straightforward tar.gz-based package system,
BSD-style initscripts, and a curated set of minimalist packages.
Zeppe-Lin focuses on simplicity, transparency, and tools that empower
users to shape their systems without unnecessary complexity.
