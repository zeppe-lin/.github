# INTRODUCTION

Zeppe-Lin is a lightweight source-based GNU/Linux distribution for the
x86-64 architecture targeted at experienced Linux users.  The primary
focus of this distribution is to keep it simple, which is reflected in
a straightforward tar.gz-based package system, BSD-style initscripts,
and a relatively small collection of trimmed packages.  The secondary
focus is the utilization of new Linux features and recent tools and
libraries.  Zeppe-Lin also has a [pkgsrc][1] system which makes it
easy to install and upgrade applications.
