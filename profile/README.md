# INTRODUCTION

Zeppe-Lin is a lightweight source-based GNU/Linux distribution for the
x86-64 architecture targeted at experienced Linux users.
It is forked from [CRUX][1] and the primary focus of this distribution
is "keep it simple" too.  The KISS principle reflects in a simple
_tar.gz_-based package system, BSD-style initscripts, and a relatively
small collection of trimmed packages.  The secondary focus is the
utilization of new Linux features and recent tools and libraries.
Zeppe-Lin also has a [pkgsrc][2] system which makes it easy to install
and upgrade applications.
